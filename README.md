## Unemployment by Age Group:

The dashboard categorizes unemployment data into seven distinct age groups, indicating a comprehensive approach to understanding how unemployment varies by age.
 The pie chart shows the distribution of unemployment across these age groups, allowing for quick identification of which groups are most affected.

## Average Unemployment by Age and Gender:

The bar chart displays the average unemployment rates segmented by age and gender, illustrating how different demographics are impacted.
For example, certain age groups (like 25 to 34) may show higher unemployment rates, suggesting that this demographic could be facing unique challenges in the job market.

## Total Unemployment by Gender:

This section provides a clear comparison between the number of unemployed men and women.
Observations may indicate whether one gender is disproportionately affected by unemployment, which can inform discussions about equality in the workforce.

## Total Unemployment by Year:

The line graph tracks unemployment trends over the years, with a notable highlight on 2015, which is marked as the year with the minimum unemployment.
This visual helps identify patterns over time, revealing whether unemployment is increasing, decreasing, or fluctuating and assisting in understanding broader economic contexts.
